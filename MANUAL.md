# Manual Setup Steps for Minions Bundle: Knowledge

This document lists the steps that must be completed manually after scaffolding.
Each step includes specific values for your bundle.

---

## 1. GitHub Repository Secrets

Go to **GitHub → mxn2020/minions-bundles-knowledge → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

| Secret | Description | Where to get it |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `NPM_TOKEN` | npm publish token | [npmjs.com → Access Tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens) |

> **Note**: If you share tokens across repos, you can use GitHub Organization secrets instead.

---

## 2. npm Packages — First Publish

Before the CI publish workflow works, you need to publish the initial version manually:

```bash
# From the project root
pnpm install
pnpm run build

# Publish bundle
npm publish --access public
```

Your package will be available at: [`minions-bundles-knowledge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minions-bundles-knowledge)

---

## 3. Release Please

Release Please is pre-configured. After your first merge to `main`:

1. A "Release PR" will be auto-created
2. Merging the Release PR creates a GitHub Release + git tag
3. The `publish.yml` workflow triggers on tags to publish to npm

Verify config:
- [`release-please-config.json`](./release-please-config.json)
- [`.release-please-manifest.json`](./.release-please-manifest.json)

---

## 4. Branch Protection

Go to **GitHub → Settings → Branches → Add rule**:

- **Branch name pattern**: `main`
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass (select: `build-and-test`)
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date
- ❌ Do not allow force pushes

---

## 5. Add to Minions Ecosystem

Update the main [minions.dev](https://minions.dev) website to include this bundle:

1. Add to the plugins/projects listing page
2. Add the project color to `color_tracking.md`
